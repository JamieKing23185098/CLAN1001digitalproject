                <p>Prometheus, indeed, was reckoned to be one of the first Titans to join Zeus in his rebellion against Cronos. According to many of the legends of our time, he was a wise advisor to the Olympians. For his service, he earned a place among the new gods. As Zeusâ€™s rule began, Prometheus was valued for his wise counsel. However, the amicable relationship between the Titan and Zeus did not last for in many matters Prometheus took the side of men, rather than the gods.</p>
