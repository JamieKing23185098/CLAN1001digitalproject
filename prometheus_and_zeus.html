            <h2>Prometheus and Zeus</h2>
            <p>Despite originally having an amicable relationship, as the great Hesiod speaks of, the trickster Prometheus deceived Zeus into accepting the bones and fat of sacrifice instead of the succulent meat, thus hid fire from mortals as punishment. Prometheus, however, stole it and returned it to Earth once again. In his other tale, Hesiod speaks of Zeus' vengeance, having Prometheus nailed to a mountain in the Caucasus and sending an eagle to eat his liver, which constantly and eternally replenished itself.</p>
